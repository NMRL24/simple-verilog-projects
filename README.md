# Digital Systems with Verilog

Welcome to this repository! ðŸŽ‰  
It is a collection of **basic and advanced digital design projects** developed using **Verilog HDL**.  
All designs are created and tested in **Vivado 2022.2 ML Edition**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ About This Repository
This repository is meant to serve as a **learning and reference hub** for digital system designs.  
Each project demonstrates concepts of:
- Combinational and sequential logic  
- Finite state machines (FSMs)  
- Counters, registers, and timing circuits  
- Control and automation systems  

The projects are organized for clarity and reusability, allowing you to **explore, learn, and extend** the designs.
